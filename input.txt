Lab 1: Introduction to AWS IAM
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that enables Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to manage users and user permissions in AWS. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.

 

Lab overview and objectives
This lab will demonstrate:

LabOverview

Exploring pre-created IAM Users and Groups

Inspecting IAM policies as applied to the pre-created groups

Following a real-world scenario, adding users to groups with specific capabilities enabled

Locating and using the IAM sign-in URL

Experimenting with the effects of policies on service access

 

AWS service restrictions
In this lab environment, access to AWS services and service actions might be restricted to the ones that are needed to complete the lab instructions. You might encounter errors if you attempt to access other services or perform actions beyond the ones that are described in this lab.

 

AWS Identity and Access Management
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) can be used to:

Manage IAM Users and their access: You can create Users and assign them individual security credentials (access keys, passwords, and multi-factor authentication devices). You can manage permissions to control which operations a User can perform.

Manage IAM Roles and their permissions: An IAM Role is similar to a User, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a Role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.

Manage federated users and their permissions: You can enable identity federation to allow existing users in your enterprise to access the AWS Management Console, to call AWS APIs and to access resources, without the need to create an IAM User for each identity.
